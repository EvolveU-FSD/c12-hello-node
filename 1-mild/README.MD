Remember BS?  It is time to implement that workflow in a program.
- create a javascript file named after the restaurant
- create a function for each orange sticky
- call the function with an object as a parameter that is the data the function needs
- each function should console.log the name of the step and the input it got
- have the function return the value that is needed as a return value
- link them together from the master function "orderShwarmaBurger()"

Hint: run your program very frequently.  Work from the outside in.
